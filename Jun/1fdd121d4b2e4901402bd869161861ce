26 June 2020 Government welcomes the judgements by the Gauteng and Western Cape High Courts that dismissed both challenges related to  the Disaster Management Act and its regulations. The Western Cape High Court dismissed an application that sought to challenge the constitutionality of the National Coronavirus Command Council as a subcommittee of Cabinet. In a separate case, the Gauteng High Court dismissed the application brought by Fair Trade Independent Tobacco Association to try and lift the ban on the sale of cigarettes in the country. GCIS Director-General, Phumla Williams said: “Government continues to remain steadfast that the ban on cigarette and tobacco product sales was put in place to protect the health of South African citizens as a result of Covid-19.” Every citizen has a role to play to prevent the spread of the virus and we need to do everything possible to minimize the burden on the already strained healthcare system. Government is appealing to all citizens to continue taking steps to protect themselves and others. Practice washing your hands often using soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub. Maintain a safe distance and stay home if you feel unwell.
