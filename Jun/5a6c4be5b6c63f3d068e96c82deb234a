26 June 2020 Government has noted with concern media statements attributed to the British American Tobacco South Africa (BATSA) to the effect that government has caused a delay in the hearing of its challenge to the ban on sales of tobacco products during Alert Level 3 of the Covid-19 national state of disaster. The relevant facts are as follows: As the sequence of events shows: Government does not have control over the scheduling of court hearings, and it did not attempt to exercise any such control in this case. BATSA’s issuing of a media statement yesterday implying that the matter would be heard on 30 June, was unfortunate because, by then, the Judge President had directed that it would be heard after 4 August.  BATSA’s media statement caused the media to report, incorrectly, that the matter would be heard on 30 June. The comments attributed to BATSA’s spokesperson in the media today to the effect that the government is the cause of the delay in the hearing and are inexplicable, are incorrect.  It was the Judge President alone who decided the matter should be heard in early August.  The Judge President took that decision yesterday morning before the State Attorney had raised the issue of the new matter in the applicants’ replying papers.  The Judge President affirmed that decision this morning after considering representations from both BATSA’s attorneys and the State Attorney.
