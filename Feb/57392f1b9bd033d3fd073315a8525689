27 January 2020 Government calls upon all South Africans to welcome Miss Universe 2019, Zozibini Tunzi, home on Saturday morning. Tunzi flew the South African flag high and that of the African continent when she bagged the coveted title during the Miss Universe pageant, last year wherein she emphasised the importance of celebrating and recognising black women and their natural beauty. She expressed her passion on the empowerment of women and fighting issues of gender-based prejudice, which is one of the priorities of government. South Africans are urged to arrive in their numbers at O R International Airport on Saturday. The build-up event will start at 7:00am on Saturday. A press conference will be held at the airport shortly after Tunzi’s arrival, where South Africans will be able to show her their love and support. On Monday, the 10th of February, Tunzi will visit Canaan Academy Primary School in the Eastern Cape. On Thursday, 13 February South Africa’s golden girl will embark on an early morning street tour of Johannesburg, and in the evening she will also be among the special guests of the President during the State of the Nation Address on 13 February 2020. As a young nation, South Africa is proud of the strides that we have made in this sector, and government is particularly proud of Zozibini Tunzi as she is the first black woman to win the competition since Leila Lopes from Angola in 2011.
