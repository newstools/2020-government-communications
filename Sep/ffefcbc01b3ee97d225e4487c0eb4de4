7 September 2020 The Inter-Ministerial Committee on COVID-19 procurement has noted several reports on the sanity of the information released by various departments. The very purpose of the committee is to ensure that there is transparency around the procurement of personal protective equipment. It is therefore encouraging that everyone is able to inspect this information and point out discrepancies where they arise. The IMC through treasury will verify all transactions at the Departments in question against the BAS system. "The value of transparency is that it allows us to all highlight discrepancies, and ensure we take corrective action immediately. In the event whereÂ  we identify elements of misconduct or criminality such information will be referred to law enforcement agencies," said Chairperson of the IMC, Minister Ronald Lamola Enquiries:Phumla WilliamsCell: 083 501 0139
