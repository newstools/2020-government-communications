21 April 2020 A virtual Special Cabinet Meeting was held on Monday, 20 April 2020, to among other things, deliberate on the consolidated report on the socio-economic recovery plan post the COVID-19 National Lockdown. During the virtual Special Cabinet Meeting held last Wednesday, the chairpersons of the five clusters – (1) Economic Sectors, Investment, Employment and Infrastructure Development; (2) Governance, State Capacity and Institutional Development; (3) Social Protection, Community and Human Development; (4) International Cooperation, Trade and Security; and (5) Justice, Crime Prevention and Security – were directed to revisit their submissions and consolidate them into one report. The consolidated submission aims to guide the country on practical ways to reignite economic growth and also proposes government interventions to deal with the socio-economic hardships caused by the COVID-19 national lockdown, particularly the absence of economic activity. Cabinet was satisfied with the proposals presented yesterday. President Cyril Ramaphosa will this evening Tuesday, 21 April 2020, address the nation to outline the expanded COVID-19 socio-economic measures that form part of the national response to the pandemic. The time will be communicated in due course. Cabinet also received an updated report on the South African Airways from Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. After appreciating the progress that has been made and other planned engagements with organised labour this week, Cabinet directed that the Inter-Ministerial Committee should meet and further process this work. A consolidated report that will have taken all the pending work into consideration will be resubmitted in the next Cabinet cycle. Appointment Cabinet also approved the appointment of Ms Avril Adelle Williamson as the Director-General of the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs.
